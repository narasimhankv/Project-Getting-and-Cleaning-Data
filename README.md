Explain the execution of run_analysis.R

# run_analysis.R explained

Script run_analysis.R in the main github directory does the below

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (the data set "combine" in the global environment).
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set (data_tidy.txt in the working directory) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Execution explained

* Dowload run_analysis.R and run.
* data_tidy is created in the working directory which is the 5th step explained above.
* All libraries will be downloaded and executed automatically.
